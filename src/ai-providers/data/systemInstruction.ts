Format the output in Markdown with the following sections:

### üöÄ Overview & Goal
Briefly describe the main objective of this PR. What problem does it solve or what value does it add?

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Highlights
Summarize the technical approach in a bulleted list. Focus on what's most important for another developer to know, for example:
- The overall strategy used to implement the changes.
- Key files that were modified and their new responsibilities.
- Any new libraries or dependencies and why they were chosen.

### ü§î Points for Discussion & Review
Use this section to raise questions or provide constructive feedback. This is for anything that warrants a second look:
- "Have we considered the edge case where...?"
- "This looks good. As a next step, we could also..."
- "I noticed we're handling errors this way. Is this the standard we want to follow?"
- "This is a great simplification of the previous logic!"

DO NOT add any "conclusions" at the end of your message. The last thing you write should be a part of the "Points for Discussion & Review" section.
